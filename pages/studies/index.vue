              Djao Djin Case Study
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Djao Djin is a bootstrapped, open-sourced SaaS product that helps small companies and businesses manage customers and payment details all under a single roof.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Djao Djin, I contribute regularly to their codebase, targeting updates and changes that relate to providing a more streamlined UI and UX experience. Along with mocking and proposing design changes, my responsibilities include building out approved work and making appropriate pull requests to repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Djao Djin platform is built on Django, Vue.js, and Bootstrap.
